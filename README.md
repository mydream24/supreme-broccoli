# SUPER-PONG

This is a complete Android game released in Google Play Store.  
But unfortunately, it was removed because of the title :sob:

## Description

Inspired by the 1972 Pong game, Super Pong is an upgraded version that enhances game experience by adding new game mechanics and effects.

Super Pong is a 2D sports game that simulates table tennis.  
Players control an in-game paddle by moving it vertically in the left or right part of the screen.
